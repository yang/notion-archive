# Mobile networks

- Carriers
    - T-Mobile has the best speeds
    - Verizon has the best coverage esp. into rural areas
    - Google Fi is based on T-Mobile and some others
    - Mint Mobile / Ultra Mobile is based on T-Mobile
- Devices
    - Google Pixel 5 supports switching between including 1 physical SIM and 1 eSIM
        - It also supports using multiple SIMs concurrently, but you specify which one is for data/call/SMS (is this DSDS?)
    - A single eSIM slot gets “taken” by any active plan. You *cannot* simply have a bunch of eSIMs that you switch among into your eSIM slot.
    - Can force your device to use 5G or 4G
