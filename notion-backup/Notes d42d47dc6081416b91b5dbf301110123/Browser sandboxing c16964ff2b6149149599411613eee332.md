# Browser sandboxing

- Approaches
    - [WorkerBox](https://workerbox.net/)
        - Code is run in it's own subdomain of workerbox.net
        - Code is run in a WebWorker
        - Host calls into guest code as async
    - Partytown
        - Not for sandboxing, but uses sync XHR hack to call between worker/main synchronously
