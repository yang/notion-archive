# Vectorization

- Scientific and numerical computing
- Column-store databases
- GPUs
- Entity component systems (ECS) in game dev
- Somewhat opposite of vectorization is deforestation, which eliminates intermediate data structures in order to process as much instruction as possible
    - So you are trading off the streaming of code vs data, to some extent
