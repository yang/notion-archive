# VLC

- Tips
    - Autodetect subs like Subs/2_English.srt: set autodetection fuzziness to -1 or it finds something with a similar filename ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/VLC/comments/5iiu5i/make_video_load_subtitle_file_automatically/))
    - Move subtitles to the top: set “Prefs > Show All > Video > Subtitles / OSD > Force subtitle position” to 800, save, restart VLC (or at least re-open the file - not sure what’s minimum needed)
    - Use compressor to adjust for too-loud SFX and too-low dialogue ([source](https://www.vlchelp.com/fix-movies-loud-music-low-dialogue/)) [VLC Compressor Settings](https://i0.wp.com/www.vlchelp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vlc-compressor-settings.png?resize=648%2C471&ssl=1)
