## Misc

- osquery

# Writing / note-taking

- Logseq: open
- Obsidian: free but closed
- Roam: paid
- Notion: paid, team-based, no knowledge graph

# Video editing

- DaVinci Resolve:
    - Free
    - Powerful, but annoying to do simple common things, like eased zoom + pan.
        - You have to rely on a custom Flex Zoom effect from the community, and even then, you have to decide on motion blur, which slows down preview and is a per-effect setting.
    - Key concepts:
        - Adjustment layer: manipulate an effect as its own timeline object, with the effect applied across multiple clips
- Screenflow
    - $100+
    - Focused, but easy to add simple common things like eased zoom + pan.
    - Motion blur is a global setting on export, so doesn’t slow down previews and doesn’t require per-effect decision.

# Gmail

- Gmail filters operate on individual messages and not the whole thread. If a message further down in the thread hits a filter and is “mark as read” and “skip the inbox”, it won’t actually cause the whole thread to become read or archived (assuming it was sitting unread in the inbox). Determined experimentally.

# Google Voice

You can have multiple Google Voice numbers forward calls to the same phone by using the [classic settings UI](https://www.google.com/voice/b/0#phones) to designate the number as a Home/Work number instead of a Mobile number (Voice just allows this for Home/Work numbers).

# Command line

```
# archive an mbox into a gmail account.
# install got-your-back, then run:
gyb [--debug] --email yangatinfer@gmail.com --action restore-mbox --local-folder ~/Downloads/mbox3/
# this will create a .sqlite file in that folder alongside the mbox, to track the progress.  this will also auto-resume by skipping over already-uploaded emails.

# rclone
time rclone -v --transfers=9 \
  --dry-run \
  --exclude GLOB \
  sync mystuff/ mit:path/to/mystuff

# mount ntfs on mac
sudo diskutil list
sudo /opt/local/bin/ntfs-3g /dev/disk2s1 /Volumes/NTFS -olocal -oallow_other

# git pull from another directory
git remote add upstream ../react-scripts
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout react-scripts
git pull upstream react-scripts

# combine audio + still image -> video

# Google Assistant

Ways we use it:

- Find my phone
- What’s the weather?  What’s the weather tomorrow?
- What’s the news?
- How do you say “giraffe” in Chinese?
- Define “ecstatic”
- Play (music) on Pandora, e.g. “Play Christmas music on Pandora” or “Play classical music on Pandora”
- Play (music or specific song) on Spotify (requires subscription)
- Call Costco (maybe you want to ask about product availability)
- Call Mom
- Add a reminder
- Set alarm for 8pm
- Set timer for 3 minutes
- Message Christine, can you get some gas
- How long will it take to drive to work?
- (General questions) What temperature should I cook lasagna at?  Where is the next Olympics?  When are the Oscars?  What are the Oscar 2018 best picture nominees?
- Play/Continue Freakonomics (podcasts)
- Play white noise

General tips:

- You can say multiple commands in a sequence without needing to say OK Google before each one.

# Routers

- Arris Gateway default login: admin / motorola

# IDEA

- Tips
    - Open any gitignore file to be prompted to mark as excluded all dirs that are ignored but not yet excluded by IntelliJ. ([source](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-140714))
- IdeaVim: not great
    - ctrl-left/right don’t work and are not configurable
    - IDEA multiple cursors completely broken, and can’t get vim multiple-cursors to work
    - shift-space doesn’t work (workaround: ctrl-space)

# VSCode

- CodeLens is somewhat nice
- VSCodeVim
    - Nicer than IdeaVim
    - Shift-space for pgup doesn't work
    - Too many little glitches, missed keystrokes
    - Undo/redo is unreliable, sometimes doing too much, sometimes forgetting things
- Randomly pauses
- Go to symbol is not as fast as InteliJ
- I’m sometimes too fast for the autocomplete
- Not autocompleting symbols from third party libraries where IntelliJ does (e.g. AsyncLock from async-lock)
- Autocomplete does not nec auto-import, sometimes have to wait at autocomplete menu for “Auto-import from…” hint to appear?
- Sometimes just starts spinning CPU and being super glitchy, not closing tabs, etc.
- Autocompletion can be extremely slow sometimes, but seems to go away on restart
- Refactoring is richer in IntelliJ—e.g. extracting variables has more options (let/const, choose scope), can replace multiple expression occurrences, etc.
- No refactorings: move, change signature, plumb param through call hierarchy, etc.
- Keystrokes get really slow and laggy after some time

# Google

## Backup and Sync

- When “Removing items” is set to “Remove items everywhere” or “Ask me” (and you answer to remove), then when you delete a file locally from one of the backed-up folders, it will also be removed from Google Drive—but *also* Google Photos if it was sent there too (because you had checked “Upload newly added photos and videos to Google Photos”)
    - This means that for the common case of just wanting to transfer (i.e. *move*) your photos from your computer to Google Photos, then you should select “Don’t remove items everywhere,” since you will regularly be clearing out that folder to make space—and you don't want clearing out the local folder to delete any photos your account!  (Especially for the workflow of transferring photos from your camera to your computer to Google Photos)
- The backup photos and videos are also kept around with in Google Drive, but they don't appear to take up space for the most part—they aren’t listed when you [view your largest files in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/quota).
    - **However,** ******it also appears that at least *some* of the backed up and uploaded *videos* *do* show up in the largest-files list, even if they would not be taking up space if they only existed within Google photos.

## Photos

- Pressing “Recover Storage” to compress Original to High Quality will not affect Original quality uploads from Pixel phones—so, it’s safe to use! ([source](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#%21topic/photos/MUDHeeyjlQE%3Bcontext-place=topicsearchin/photos/recover%2420storage%2420pixel), [source](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#%21msg/phone-by-google/Lq2qVl7buug/SuEB5Q6hBQAJ))

# Doom, Brutal Doom, Project Brutality

- Background
    - GZDoom seems to be the main/most popular Doom source port
    - Brutal Doom is a slower moving mod, Project Brutality feels like BD + a lot more stuff (and I think higher volume of recent activity).
    - you generally still need the original Doom wads, but these can be easily found.
    - HUD Mods: I found [Ultimate Doom visor (UDV)](https://www.moddb.com/addons/doomvisor-hud-for-pa1nki113r-v51) to be the most interesting, but [Cats Visor](https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/addons/catsvisor-hud-12-for-bd21-more-widescreen) also seemed to be popular.
    - You can [mod the soundtrack](https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/downloads/doom-metal-soundtrack-mod-volume-5) too.
    - I basically found out a bunch of these mods via YouTube videos.
    - I briefly tried some [other level mods](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=59041), but didn't have any luck.
- How to run
    - after installing gzdoom, mkdir and go to ~/Library/Application Support/gzdoom/.  This is where all your wads and pk3's go.
    - to start Doom with wads, you either drag them over into the Doom application, or you can use a utility like zdl, but I've never used it. The only tricky thing with dragging files is that you need to make sure you are specifying the correct load order. This can be controlled using filename lexicographic ordering.
    - for project brutality, you can download the entire Source repo from GitHub as a zip file and simply rename it to pk3. This actually works!
    - Usually, you want the order to be:
        - Some base map/level WAD (like doom.wad, doom2.wad, etc.)
        - Your gameplay mod (BD, PB, etc.)
        - Your other mods after that.  I've had luck with music, resolution pack, and HUD.

# Chrome on Ubuntu Server

- [Install desktop and VNC](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/remote-desktop/install-vnc-on-ubuntu-18-04/#connect-to-vnc-from-your-desktop)
- `sudo apt-get install xdg-utils`
- [Install Chrome](https://askubuntu.com/a/1132007/14829)
- Notes:
    - When Yang’s Chrome profile is synced down and that profile is started, then VNC keyboard stops working, until Chrome exits.
