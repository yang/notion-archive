# Python

- pipx: install Python “end-user programs” in their own virtualenvs. Nice and easy.
    - pipx install cookiecutter poetry
- Scaffolding:
    - Use hypermodern Python:
        
        ```jsx
        cookiecutter gh:cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python --checkout=2021.3.14
        # Then
        poetry install -D nox nox-poetry
        cat > poetry.toml
        [virtualenvs]
        create = true
        in-project = true
        ^D
        ```
        
    - The above still has [roadmap work ahead](https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python/issues/450)
    - PyScaffold: doesn’t include poetry, github actions, etc. uses putup to keep things up to date
- Standard library
    - Use concurrent.futures over multiprocessing for more [robust behavior](https://schwifty50.medium.com/python-multiprocessing-misc-98e059d99194)
